This is a JavaScript code that implements a basic Expense Tracker application. It allows users to add, edit, and delete expenses, and the data is stored in the localStorage of the browser, ensuring persistence even after page reloads. Let's go step-by-step and break down how it works:

1. HTML Structure:
The HTML defines the layout and form for the Expense Tracker. Here’s a breakdown:

Form Elements:
expense-name: A text input for the name of the expense (e.g., "Groceries").
expense-amount: A number input for the amount of the expense (e.g., 50.00).
expense-date: A date input to select the date of the expense.
Add Expense button: Submits the form to add a new expense.
Expense List: A div with the id expense-list where each expense item will be displayed after being added.
Total Expenses: A section showing the total sum of all added expenses with the id total-amount.
2. JavaScript Explanation:
Event Listener for Page Load:
javascript
Copy
Edit
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    console.log("Page Loaded!");
    // ... other code
});
The DOMContentLoaded event ensures that the script runs only after the HTML document is fully loaded. This helps ensure all elements are available when interacting with them via JavaScript.

Variables Setup:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const expenseForm = document.getElementById("expense-form");
const expenseList = document.getElementById("expense-list");
const totalAmountElement = document.getElementById("total-amount");
let totalAmount = 0;
let editMode = false;
let editId = null;
expenseForm: Represents the form used to submit new expenses.
expenseList: The container where the expenses will be displayed.
totalAmountElement: The element displaying the total amount of expenses.
totalAmount: Keeps track of the total amount of expenses, initialized to 0.
editMode: A flag that indicates whether the user is editing an existing expense or adding a new one.
editId: Stores the ID of the expense that is being edited.
Loading Expenses from LocalStorage:
javascript
Copy
Edit
loadExpenses();
This function is called as soon as the page loads to retrieve any previously saved expenses from the browser's localStorage and display them.

Form Submission:
javascript
Copy
Edit
expenseForm.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // ... other code
});
When the form is submitted, this event listener is triggered:

e.preventDefault() prevents the default form submission behavior, which would normally reload the page.
It retrieves values from the form inputs (expense-name, expense-amount, and expense-date).
If all fields are filled correctly, it creates an expense object. If the form is in edit mode, it updates the expense; otherwise, it adds a new one.
The form is reset, and the mode is set back to add mode (not editing).
Adding Expenses:
javascript
Copy
Edit
function addExpense(expense) {
    const expenseItem = document.createElement("div");
    expenseItem.classList.add("expense-item");
    expenseItem.setAttribute("data-id", expense.id);
    expenseItem.innerHTML = `<span>${expense.name} - $${expense.amount.toFixed(2)} (${expense.date})</span> <div>
        <button type="button" class="edit-btn">Edit</button>
        <button type="button" class="delete-btn">❌</button>
    </div>`;
    expenseList.appendChild(expenseItem);
}
A new div element is created for each expense, displaying the expense's name, amount, and date.
Two buttons are added: one for editing (edit-btn) and one for deleting (delete-btn).
The expense item is then appended to the expense-list container.
Editing Expenses:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const editBtn = expenseItem.querySelector(".edit-btn");
editBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
    setEditMode(expense);
});
When the Edit button is clicked, the setEditMode() function is called, which enables edit mode for that expense.
javascript
Copy
Edit
function setEditMode(expense) {
    editMode = true;
    editId = expense.id;

    document.getElementById("expense-name").value = expense.name;
    document.getElementById("expense-amount").value = expense.amount;
    document.getElementById("expense-date").value = expense.date;

    expenseForm.querySelector("button").textContent = "Update Expense";
}
Edit Mode: The form is populated with the data of the selected expense, allowing the user to modify it.
The submit button text changes to “Update Expense” to reflect that the form is now in edit mode.
Deleting Expenses:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const deleteBtn = expenseItem.querySelector(".delete-btn");
deleteBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
    expenseItem.remove();
    updateTotalAmount(-expense.amount);
    removeExpenseFromLocalStorage(expense.id);
});
When the Delete button is clicked, the corresponding expense item is removed from the UI.
The total amount is updated (subtracting the amount of the deleted expense).
The expense is also removed from localStorage.
Updating Total Amount:
javascript
Copy
Edit
function updateTotalAmount(amount) {
    totalAmount += amount;
    totalAmountElement.textContent = `$${totalAmount.toFixed(2)}`;
}
This function adds or subtracts the expense amount to/from the total amount and updates the display.

Saving to LocalStorage:
javascript
Copy
Edit
function saveExpenseToLocalStorage(expense) {
    const expenses = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("expenses")) || [];
    expenses.push(expense);
    localStorage.setItem("expenses", JSON.stringify(expenses));
}
The new or updated expense is saved to localStorage so it persists even if the user refreshes the page.
Loading from LocalStorage:
javascript
Copy
Edit
function loadExpenses() {
    const expenses = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("expenses")) || [];
    expenses.map((expense) => {
        addExpense(expense);
        updateTotalAmount(expense.amount);
    });
}
When the page loads, the expenses are retrieved from localStorage, and each one is displayed on the page. The total is also updated accordingly.
Removing from LocalStorage:
javascript
Copy
Edit
function removeExpenseFromLocalStorage(id) {
    let expenses = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("expenses")) || [];
    expenses = expenses.filter((expense) => expense.id !== id);
    localStorage.setItem("expenses", JSON.stringify(expenses));
}
This function removes an expense from localStorage by filtering out the expense with the matching id.
How the Whole System Works:
Page Load: On loading the page, any previously stored expenses are loaded from localStorage and displayed.
Adding Expenses: Users can add new expenses through the form. Each expense is displayed in the list with an Edit and Delete button.
Editing Expenses: Clicking the Edit button loads the expense into the form for editing, and the user can update it.
Deleting Expenses: Clicking the Delete button removes the expense from the list and updates the total.
Persistence: All changes (adding, editing, deleting) are reflected in localStorage, so the data persists even after refreshing the page.
Final Notes:
localStorage is used to persist expenses. The data is saved locally in the browser, meaning the information will stay even if the page is refreshed or closed.
This tracker allows the user to manage their expenses without relying on a server or database.
