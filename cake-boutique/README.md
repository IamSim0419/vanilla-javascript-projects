# Cake Boutique Test

Welcome to the Cake Boutique test project! This project showcases a beautiful website for a cake boutique.

## Fonts

The original fonts provided in the `assets` directory were different from what was required. Therefore, I looked for similar styles on Google Fonts and used them as replacements.

### Original Fonts

The following fonts were provided in the `assets/fonts` directory:

- Corporate S Light Regular.otf
- CromlinDEMO-Regular.otf
- BROWN SUNFLOWER.ttf
- CormorantGaramond-LightItalic.ttf

### Google Fonts Replacements

I replaced the original fonts with the following Google Fonts:

- ** - Italiana-Regular.ttf etc.
